We sends webhooks to notify you about important events related to `transfers`, `deposits`, `swaps`, `onramps`, and `offramps`. You can configure webhooks in your dashboard or [via API](/api-reference/notifications/create-webhook) to receive notifications.

## Webhook Events

The following events are available:

| Event | Description |
|:-----------|:------------|
| `deposit:pending` | Deposit transaction has been initiated |
| `deposit:processing` | Deposit transaction is being processed |
| `deposit:completed` | Deposit transaction has been completed |
| `deposit:failed` | Deposit transaction has failed |
| `offramp:pending` | Offramp transaction has been initiated |
| `offramp:processing` | Offramp transaction is being processed |
| `offramp:completed` | Offramp transaction has been completed |
| `offramp:failed` | Offramp transaction has failed |
| `swap:pending` | Swap transaction has been initiated |
| `swap:processing` | Swap transaction is being processed |
| `swap:completed` | Swap transaction has been completed |
| `swap:failed` | Swap transaction has failed |
| `onramp:pending` | Onramp transaction has been initiated |
| `onramp:processing` | Onramp transaction is being processed |
| `onramp:completed` | Onramp transaction has been completed |
| `onramp:failed` | Onramp transaction has failed |

## Webhook Verification

To ensure the authenticity of webhook requests, We sign each webhook with your unique webhook secret key. You should verify the signature before processing the webhook notification received.

```typescript
import crypto from 'crypto';

app.post('/your-webhook-endpoint', (req, res) => {
  const signatureFromHeader = req.header('x-webhook-signature');
  const yourWebhookSecret = process.env.YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET!;

  const bodyString = JSON.stringify(req.body);
  const computedSignature = crypto.createHmac('sha256', yourWebhookSecret).update(bodyString).digest('hex');

  if (!signatureFromHeader || computedSignature !== signatureFromHeader) {
    return res.status(401).send('Invalid webhook signature');
  }

  const { event, payload } = req.body;
  res.status(200).send('Webhook received successfully');
});
```
